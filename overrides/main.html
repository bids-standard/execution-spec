    <h2><b>THIS SITE IS BEING MERGED</b><br></h2>

    <h3>
      The BIDS group is currently finalizing a NEW main website that will merge our existing websites into one central, easy to navigate resource. <br>
      The <b><a href="https://bids-website.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">New BIDS Website</a> (https://bids-website.readthedocs.io)</b>
      is still being finalized, but we encourage feedback via the <br>
      giscus form on the bottom of the main page. <br>
    </h3>

    Please feel free to submit suggestions or comments as we improve and consolidate our existing BIDS resources.
